# Hibernate-Book
A practice of Hibernate table hierarchy using JOINED strategy with MySQL database. Create three entity: Book class, SEBook class which means special edition, and INBook class
for books in many languages.

SEBook and INBook inherit from super class Book. And after execution, there will be three tables in MySQL.
